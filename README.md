# LiDAR-based-3D-Mapping-project

Keil involves manually pushing a button that rotates a stepper motor. LiDAR sensor attached to stepper motor captures distance measurments that are sent to the micro controller through UART and to the PC(Python) through C2C. Python stores and maps the captured points, creating a slice of the hallway that the user is in. Multiple slices result in a 3D visualization of the hallway.
