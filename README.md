# LiDAR-based-3D-Mapping-project

This is the code for a 3D-Mapping project which utilizes a Time of Flight(ToF) sensor connected to a TI microcontroller to capture distance measurmements which are three dimensionally graphed using a Python Script.

## Features

- start/stop the capture of data with the click of a button on the microcontroller(The sensor itself stops capturing data, and the stepper motor it is connected to stops its rotation)
- realign the stepper motor to original positoning
- Choice to Graph data or continue taking measurements
- Wipe existing data
